Fun project. I wish I had more time from my schedule to add more features.
There were a lot of migrations, as I had to keep making changes based on my needs during the project.

The web app shows the items in a different arrangement. The user makes a choice from the list of products and then can make additional selections within that product.
I used images to make it more user friendly.

A user needs to login/register to use the app. Once loggedin they can view products, their cart and make payments online.
I added the stripe modal to allow users pay online.

To use the stripe payment, you will need to use
- one of their test cards from https://stripe.com/docs/testing#cards
- Any random, syntactically valid email address (the more random, the better)
- Any three-digit CVC code
- Any expiration date in the future
- Any billing postal code, such as 12345
